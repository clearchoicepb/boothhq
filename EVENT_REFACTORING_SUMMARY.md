# Event Detail Page Refactoring - Quick Summary

**Status:** 📋 Planning Complete - Ready for Review  
**Target:** `src/app/[tenant]/events/[id]/page.tsx` (3,373 lines)

---

## 🎯 THE PLAN IN 60 SECONDS

### What We're Doing:
Taking the 3,373-line event detail page and breaking it into:
- **6 custom hooks** (data, tabs, staff, modals, editing, references)
- **21 UI components** (badges, cards, lists, modals)
- **3 utility files** (status colors, date helpers, validation)
- **1 clean main file** (~750 lines - just orchestration)

### Why:
- 78% reduction in main file complexity
- Reusable components across event pages
- Easier to maintain and test
- Faster feature development

### Time:
10-11 hours over 2-3 days

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATE (What We Found)

### File Analysis:
```
Total Lines: 3,373
State Variables (useState): 50
Data Fetching Functions (useCallback): 11
Effects (useEffect): 2
Tabs/Sections: 11
Inline Modals: 6+
Utility Functions: 3
```

### Major Sections:
1. Overview (event info, dates, account/contact)
2. Invoices
3. Activity timeline
4. Files/Attachments
5. Tasks
6. Design items
7. Logistics
8. Communications
9. Staffing (complex!)
10. Equipment/Booth assignments
11. Scope/Details

### Complexity Hotspots:
- **50 useState hooks** (way too many!)
- **Staff management** (multiple sub-states)
- **Modal coordination** (6+ modals)
- **Inline editing** (description, payment status, account/contact)
- **Tab-specific data loading**

---

## 🔧 THE SOLUTION (What We'll Build)

### Phase 1: Extract 6 Custom Hooks (~3 hours)

```typescript
useEventData        // Core event + dates fetching
useEventTabs        // Tab content loading (invoices, activities, etc.)
useEventStaff       // Staff assignment management
useEventModals      // All modal states centralized
useEventEditing     // Inline editing states
useEventReferences  // Dropdown data (accounts, contacts, locations)
```

### Phase 2: Extract 21 Components (~4.5 hours)

**Easy (8 components):**
- EventStatusBadge, EventTypeBadge, EventProgressIndicator
- EventStatCard, PaymentStatusBadge, EventHeader
- EmptyState, LoadingState

**Medium (9 components):**
- EventInformationCard, EventDatesCard, EventAccountContactCard
- EventDescriptionCard, EventInvoicesList, EventActivitiesList
- EventCommunicationsList, EventStaffList, EventTabsNavigation

**Complex (4 components):**
- EventDateDetailModal, CommunicationDetailModal
- ActivityDetailModal, EventOverviewTab

### Phase 3: Extract 3 Utility Files (~1 hour)

```typescript
event-utils.ts       // Status colors, progress calculations
event-date-utils.ts  // Date/time formatting
event-validation.ts  // Form validation (optional)
```

### Phase 4: Final Cleanup (~1 hour)

- Review main file (~750 lines)
- Add documentation
- Final testing
- Commit

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS

### Before:
```
src/app/[tenant]/events/[id]/page.tsx
├─ 3,373 lines (monolithic)
└─ Everything in one file
```

### After:
```
src/hooks/
├─ useEventData.ts (200 lines)
├─ useEventTabs.ts (220 lines)
├─ useEventStaff.ts (170 lines)
├─ useEventModals.ts (135 lines)
├─ useEventEditing.ts (115 lines)
└─ useEventReferences.ts (90 lines)

src/components/events/
├─ [8 easy components] (420 lines)
├─ [9 medium components] (1,400 lines)
└─ [4 complex components] (780 lines)

src/lib/utils/
├─ event-utils.ts (135 lines)
├─ event-date-utils.ts (90 lines)
└─ event-validation.ts (75 lines)

src/app/[tenant]/events/[id]/page.tsx
└─ 750 lines (orchestration only)
```

**Total:** ~4,580 lines (organized) vs 3,373 (monolithic)  
**Main File:** 78% reduction (3,373 → 750)

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Breaking functionality | 🔴 HIGH | Test after each phase, commit often |
| Complex dependencies | 🟡 MEDIUM | Start with isolated pieces |
| Auth/permissions | 🟡 MEDIUM | Keep auth checks at top level |
| Modal coordination | 🟡 MEDIUM | Centralize in useEventModals |
| Performance | 🟢 LOW | Use React.memo if needed |

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Must Have:
- [ ] Main file <850 lines
- [ ] All functionality works
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Manual testing passes

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Performance same or better
- [ ] Components reusable
- [ ] Code easier to understand
- [ ] Team approval

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Review the detailed plan:** `EVENT_DETAIL_PAGE_REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
2. **Get approval** from team/stakeholders
3. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b event-detail-refactoring
   ```
4. **Start Phase 1:** Extract useEventData hook
5. **Follow the roadmap** and commit frequently

---

## 💡 LESSONS FROM OPPORTUNITIES REFACTORING

### What Worked Well:
✅ Phased approach (hooks → components → utilities)  
✅ Starting with easy pieces first  
✅ Frequent commits  
✅ Testing after each phase

### What to Improve:
⚠️ Apply utilities more consistently from the start  
⚠️ Better component naming conventions  
⚠️ Document props more thoroughly

### Applying to Events:
- Use same phased approach ✅
- Extract hooks before components ✅
- Test thoroughly after each phase ✅
- Create utility files early ✅

## 🎓 KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Complexity:** Events page is 53% larger than opportunities (3,373 vs 2,200 lines)
2. **Similar Approach:** Same proven refactoring strategy
3. **More State:** 50 useState hooks vs ~40 in opportunities
4. **More Tabs:** 11 tabs vs 3 views in opportunities
5. **Staff Management:** Most complex piece (unique to events)
6. **Estimated Time:** 11 hours vs 8 hours for opportunities
7. **Expected Reduction:** 78% (similar to 75% for opportunities)
